*Breathe Easy* is one of Virginia Commonwealth University's senior capstone projects for the class of 2025. We are developing a spirometer (lung capacity testing machine) to work anywhere - not just in clinics. We hope that this design will be low cost and rugged enough to make a difference where it matters.
